# WDA_CapstoneProject

A simple Website that uses the Bulma CSS Framework for styling, and contains a serviceWorker that helps to cache files to the user's browser. This website serves as a portfolio website for a programmer tell others more about himself, showcase some of his past projects, and to provide methods of contacting him. Though a form is provided for users to send an email, it is merely cosmetic for now and additional functionality may be added on when needed.
