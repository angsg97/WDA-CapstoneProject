# WDA_CapstoneProject

A simple Responsive Website that uses the Bulma CSS Framework for styling, and contains a serviceWorker that helps to cache files to the user's browser. This website serves as a portfolio website for a programmer tell others more about himself, showcase some of his past projects, and to provide methods of contacting him. Though a form is provided for users to send an email, it is merely cosmetic for now and additional functionality may be added on when needed.

Addtionally, it also serves as a Progressive Web App that can be installed, with a prompt and a button that the user can press. On computers, this allows the app to be installed on the user's Home Screen, and on mobile, the app can be installed as an App that appears in the user's app drawer.
